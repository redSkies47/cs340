# cs340-movie-theater-database-portfolio

### About
This project was the quarter long project for the class CS 340 Introduction to Databases. It is a portfolio project done in collaboration between Jonathan Chan and Steven Ruzicka.

This project started from a database need. We developed this idea into a stable database. We also applied a web-based UI with full CRUD functionalities. It is our showcase of the many database skills we have picked up so far.

### Skills

- Produced both DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) queries for a clear API when interacting with the database
- Collaborating with a peer by using Github and Git
- Deployed a frontend web app using Handlebars, Javascript, CSS and HTML
